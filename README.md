# BFS with Cost Pathfinding Algorithm in Python
This repository includes an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm modified to handle grids with variable costs. This version of BFS is adapted to work with weighted grids where each cell has a specific cost associated with moving into it.

# Features
- Modified BFS Algorithm: An adaptation of the traditional BFS to account for cell costs, ensuring the pathfinding algorithm considers the cumulative cost to reach each cell.
- Cost Calculation: Accurately computes the total cost of the path by summing the costs of the cells traversed.
- Grid Visualization: Displays the grid with obstacles, start and goal points, and the computed path, highlighting the cost at each step.

# Installation
To use this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the necessary dependencies with:
```python
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
